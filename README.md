# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 
The school board has asked Maria for a school district analysis of all the reading and math scores of all the high schools in the district. We completed this analysis howevever, Maria has been told there is some academic dishonesty relating to the reading and math scores in the ninth grade at Thomas High School. Maria has asked us to repeat the school district analysis, while replacing the math and reading scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaN's in order to uphold state-testing standings. 

## Results
We were able to complete the school district analysis with the Thomas High School ninth grade scores removed.
